# predictive-model-logistic-regression
In this project, I used demographic, pre-college, college, and attitude variables to explore and build predictive models of four cohorts. The attitude variables were from orientation surveys and were analyzed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. One cohort was used as a test data set. The three other cohorts were used as the training data sets. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated with different thresholds. Tableau was used to visualize the data.
